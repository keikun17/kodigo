# Action Cable 

## Minimum setup required to get action cable working on Rails

### Edit `config/cable.yml` (file generated by new Rails 5 app generator)

You might want to edit it to make it look like this :

```
# app/config/redis/cable.yml
development: &development
  :url: redis://localhost:6379
  :host: localhost
  :port: 6379
  :timeout: 1
  :inline: true
test: *development
```



### 2. Add `cable` to the javascript manifest

```
# app/assets/javascripts/application.js
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require turbolinks
//= require cable
//= require_tree .

```

this will load `app/javascripts/cable.coffee` or `app/javascripts/cable.js` to your application.
All js files that are has cable js functions and actions should be loaded from here.
This file is the manifest for action cable js files
